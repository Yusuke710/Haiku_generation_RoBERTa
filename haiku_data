11274, pissing with the neighbor  evening snow
11275, on a half snow half mud road  slogging along
11276, on a snowy day the temple is packed  pigeons sparrows
11277, the huts dog is escort to the winter prayers
11278,  Its Bashos Death Day  he says to himself
11279, walking into sunset on Bashos Death Day  straw sandals
11280, Bashos Death Day  from noon on open house at the hut
11281, sneezing I take another sake break  sweeping soot
11282, in a package from Edo new clothes and Im not his dad
11283, beautiful courtesan  new clothes for her hometowns Buddha
11284, the dog braces himself  snowball
11285, the do gooder reluctantly begins  his winter seclusion
11286, pufferfish soup  all the houses snoring together
11287, house of reeds where plovers sleep plastered with crap
11288, beach plovers raise a ruckus  the dog runs away
11289, entering Kyoto too a bunch of sour faced pufferfish
11290, with a radish driving off a deer  his field
11291, the little imp totes one too  radishes
11292, so that the nightingale can make a living fallen leaves
11293, frost killed grass  the poor town stretches foolishly long
11294, Musashi Plain  in its standing water Mount Fuji
11295, spring breeze  across the field a parade of pale blue parasols
11296, timing his death extremely well  the Buddha
11297, observing well this world of blossoms  Buddha dies
11298, a nightingale sings  the empty palace his field
11299, the baby swallows flying lesson  off the horses rump
11300, taming the flesh he moves through thorns  a frog
11301, hot tub steam wafts softly softly  as does a butterfly
11302, some of them stick to people young grasses at their peak
11303, cherry blossom shade  no sleeping for me feeling afraid
11304, the world today umbrella hatted princes and paupers blossom viewing
11305, imitating the menacing dog  blossom viewing
11306, mountain temple  below where I sprawl clouds of blossoms
11307, the price of grain falls bitterly  the heat
11308, garden at the gate  a tailor made little cloudburst
11309, through a hole you can see the lake  billowing clouds
11310, making mountains rise in the clouds  cawing crow
11311, burning trash in a field  billowing clouds
11312, less high than the sins of men   billowing clouds
11313, lacking the good sense to form billows  rushing clouds
11314, cleaning the well  on a stone a bottle of sacred sake
11315, even cool air basking not worth the bother  moon at the gate
11316, safe and sound in the healing hot spring my arms flea
11317, eager for my return they gathered and gathered  house sitting fleas
11318, lets go then into the autumn evening for our farewells
11319, in my sake cup down the hatch the Milky Way
11320, old wall  from whichever hole autumn moon
11321, for the children rice cakes while they gaze  almost harvest moon
11322, secluded house  in the mood tonight to moon gaze
11323, harvest moon  even crabs claim the name  Taira 
11324, pretending to watch the harvest moon  rice field gazing
11325, a world healing night of the 15th  moon gazing
11326, river by the gate  thrown in a corner the Ninth month moon
11327, dewdrops forming  when might I become grass or a tree ?

11334, my beloved cherry tree cooked too  making charcoal
11335, New Years Day  all of us in a corrupt worlds blossoms
11336, even the cart man wears a courtiers hat  plum blossoms
11337, flowing water spells the character  heart   plum blossoms
11338, at the dinner trays edge  a green rice field
11339, he circles his rice field an open fan tucked behind
11340, stuttering about the olden days  a cuckoo
11341, burned field  theyre becoming desperate mosquito whines
11342, behind the morning glories a hell of fleas
11343, let it be let it be the flea has children
11344, sweeping fleas onto the highway  moonlit night
11345, world of man  in a little stone field catching fleas
11346, world of man  even walking on sand picking up fleas
11347, on burnt ground the fleas throw a wild party
11348, after the fire  the fleas throw a wild party
11349, my skinny fleas such cute darlings  house sitting
11350, growing fond of splashing soup stock  a cold night
11351, the naked partys nakedness  a cold night
11352, moon in the autumn dawn  nearing months end lantern in the eaves
11353, my home village at the end of that cloud  autumn dusk
11354, at the shrine children sumo wrestlers  autumn wind
11355, pipe smoke blowing it tastes like tobacco  autumn wind
11356, on green reeds in a row  Bon Festival Buddhas
11357, Bon presents  before long itll be us on the straw mat
11358, bonfires for the dead  soon theyll burn for us
11359, dawn of the months last day  for Bon lanterns in the eaves
11360, one dies out two die out  lanterns for the dead
11361, borrowing the light of bonfires spelling  Great   Buddha
11362, maiden flower wriggle a bit more  Tanabata night
11363, on Tanabata night a field full of children  plume grass
11364, after Tanabata Nights coolness a hot tub soak
11365, the pony stepping and crunching  chestnuts in the field
11366, knocking chestnuts out of the little garden  thief cat
11367, hes also in no mood to sweep the snow  scarecrow
11368, even to the approaching dog  Whos there ?  winter quilt
11369, dismounting  the cold snap hits the servants butt
